The production had many problems, and it is not before the AKM (modernised) that the rifle truly took over the world. It is often said that the AK is a copy of the Sturmgewehr, but its operation is markedly different, and perhaps more inspired by the US M1 Garand. It also shows a difference in doctrine: the StG is a rifle replacement, whereas the AK was originally an SMG replacement, hence its higher rate of fire."
