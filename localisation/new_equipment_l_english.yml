 SOV_infantry_equipment_4_desc: "The AK was designed by Mikhail Kalashnikov towards and after the end of World War 2, adopted in 1947, and put in mass production in 1949. The production had many problems, and it is not before the AKM (modernised) that the rifle truly took over the world. It is often said that the AK is a copy of the Sturmgewehr, but its operation is markedly different, and perhaps more inspired by the US M1 Garand. It also shows a difference in doctrine: the StG is a rifle replacement, whereas the AK was originally an SMG replacement, hence its higher rate of fire."
